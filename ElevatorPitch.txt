I have over ten years of sale experience.  I ran a mortgage company, was a manager for Verizon wireless and tons of real world experience.  Therefore have the ability to not only code, but to coordinate with clients.  I have no problem pitching to potential clients to expand opportunities	and help grow the company.  I decided to learn to code because I get a great deal of satisfaction creating products to help benefit everyone.  Also, because I have so much experience I can bring to the table many insights that the average programmer would never see.  I am honest, caring and have spent many hours going above and behind to insure success for my team.
